## Description
The back-end database is designed for e-commerce websites, utilizing an Express.js API and Sequelize to connect to a MySQL database. It enables users to create a development database, seed it with test data, and sync Sequelize models to the MySQL database. Users can leverage GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes to display and manipulate data within the database. Give it a try and see how it helps your company reach the next level!

# Overview

## The Challenge:
This challenge involves creating an e-commerce back-end site that connects to a MySQL database using Sequelize. It should create and seed a development database, sync Sequelize models, and display data from categories, products, and tags in formatted JSON. The application must support creating, updating, and deleting data using GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes.

## User Story
```md
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
```

## Acceptance Criteria
```md
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
